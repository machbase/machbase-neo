## TAKE()

*Syntax*: `TAKE( n )`

Takes first *n* records and stop the stream.

- `n` `number` specify how may records to be taken.

## DROP()

*Syntax*: `DROP( n )`

Ignore first *n* records, it simply drops the *n* records.

- `n` `number` specify how may records to be dropped.

## PUSHKEY()

*Syntax*: `PUSHKEY( newkey )`

Apply new key on each record. The orignal key is push into value tuple.

For example, if an original record was `{key: 'k1', value: [v1, v2]}` and applied `PUSHKEY(newkey)`, it produces the updated record as `{key: newkey, values: [k1, v1, v1]}`.

## POPKEY()

*Syntax*: `POPKEY( tuple, idx )`

Drop current key of the record, then promote *idx*th element of *tuple* as a new key.

For example, if an original record was `{key: k, value: [v1, v2, v3]}` and applied `POPKEY(V, 1)`, it produces the updated record as `{key: v2, value:[v1, v3]}`.

## GROUPBYKEY()

*Syntax*: `GROUPBYKEY( [lazy(boolean)] )`

- `lazy(boolean)` If it set `false` which is default *GROUPBYKEY()* yields new grouped record when the key of incoming record has changed from previous record. If it set `true`, *GROUPBYKEY()* waits the end of the input stream before yield any record. 

Takes multiple continuous records that have same key, then produces a new record which have value array contains all individual values.

For example, if an original records was `{key:k, value:[v1, v2]}`, `{key:k, value:{v3, v4}}`...`{key:k, value:{vx, vy}}`, it produces the new record as `{key:k, value:[[v1,v2],[v3,v4],...,[vx,vy]]}`.

The *GROUPBYKEY()* works comparing the key of current record to previous one, if it found the key has been changed, then produces new record. As result it can makes a group only if the continuous records have same key.

## FLATTEN()

*Syntax*: `FLATTEN()`

It works the oposite way of *GROUPBYKEY()*. Take a record whose value is multi-dimension tuple, produces multiple records for each elements of the tuple reducing the dimension.

For example, if an original record was `{key:k, value:[[v1,v2],[v3,v4],...,[vx,vy]]}`, it produces the new multiple records as `{key:k, value:[v1, v2]}`, `{key:k, value:{v3, v4}}`...`{key:k, value:{vx, vy}}`.

## FILTER()

*Syntax*: `FILTER( condition )`

Apply the condition statement on the incoming record, then it pass the record only if the *condition* is *true*.

For example, if an original record was `{key: k1, value[v1, v2]}` and apply `FILTER(count(V) > 2)`, it simply drop the record. If the codition was `FILTER(count(V) >= 2)`, it pass the record to the next function.

## FFT()

*Syntax*: `FFT()`

It assumes value of the incoming record is an array of *time,amplitude* tuples, then applies *Fast Fourier Transform* on the array and replaces the value with an array of *frequency,amplitude* tuples. The key remains same.

For example, if the incoming record was `{key: k, value[ [t1,a1],[t2,a2],...[tn,an] ]}`, it transforms the value to `{key:k, value[ [F1,A1], [F2,A2],...[Fm,Am] ]}`.

## SCRIPT()

*Syntax*: `SCRIPT({ ... script code... })`

Supporting script language

1. tengo
 [tengo](https://github.com/d5/tengo) is a Golang like script.
 Supports all builtin pakcages(math, text, times, rand, fmt, json, base64, hex) of tengo except "os" excluded for the security reason.
 And added "context" package for exposing the TQL specific features.
