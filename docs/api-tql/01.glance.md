# Glance at TQL

machbase-neo supports Transforming Query Language and execution API.

As application developers, we generally take similar approching to build applications that utilize databases.
The process is starting typically with quering database and retrieving data in a tabular form(rows and colums), converting it into the desired data structure,
then manipulating and displaying the final result into demanded shapes such as JSON, CSV or chart.

TQL is simplifying this process within few lines of script. And other inter-working applications call the TQL via HTTP endpoint as if it is an executable API.


{: .warning }
> Current TQL feature is in beta stage. The syntax of script is subject to change.

## Generate data

1. Open machbase-neo web UI with your web browser, the default address is http://127.0.0.1:5654/, username 'sys' and password 'manager'.
2. Select "TQL" on the 'New...' page.

3. Copy and paste the sample TQL code into the TQL editor.
    ```js
    FAKE( oscillator(freq(1.5, 1.0), range('now', '3s', '10ms')) )
    CHART_LINE()
    ```
4. Then click ▶︎ icon on the top left of the editor, it will display a line chart as the below image.
    which is a wave that has 1.5 Hz frequency and 1.0 amplitude.

5. Change `CHART_LINE()` to `CSV()` and execute again, it will show the result in CSV format.

## TQL as an API

Save this code as `hello.tql` (click save icon on the top right of the editor) and open it with web browser at [http://127.0.0.1:5654/db/tql/hello.tql](http://127.0.0.1:5654/db/tql/hello.tql), or use *curl* command on the terminal.

    ```sh
    curl -o - http://127.0.0.1:5654/db/tql/hello.tql
    ```

    ```sh
    $ curl -o - -v http://127.0.0.1:5654/db/tql/hello.tql
    ...omit...
    >
    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < Content-Type: text/csv
    < Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    <
    1686787739025518000,-0.238191
    1686787739035518000,-0.328532
    1686787739045518000,-0.415960
    1686787739055518000,-0.499692
    1686787739065518000,-0.578992
    ...omit...
    ```

## JSON()

Let's try to change `CSV()` to `JSON()`, save and execute again.
    ![web-hello-tql-json](/assets/img/web-hello-tql-json.jpg)

    And invoke the hello.tql with `curl` from terminal.

    ```sh
    $ curl -o - -v http://127.0.0.1:5654/db/tql/hello.tql
    ...omit...
    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < Content-Type: application/json
    < Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    <
    {
    "data": {
        "columns": [ "time", "value" ],
        "types": [ "datetime", "double" ],
        "rows": [
        [ 1686788907538618000, 0.9344920354538058 ],
        [ 1686788907548618000, 0.8968436523101743 ],
        ...omit...
    },
    "success": true,
    "reason": "success",
    "elapse": "956.291µs"
    }
    ```

If you are developing a data visualization application, it shall be helpful to know that *tql* JSON output supports transpose the result in columns instead of rows. Apply `JSON( transpose(true) )` and invoke it again. The result JSON contains *cols* array.

    ```sh
    $ curl -o - -v http://127.0.0.1:5654/db/tql/hello.tql
    ...omit...
    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < Content-Type: application/json
    < Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    <
    {
    "data": {
        "columns": [ "time", "value" ],
        "types": [ "datetime", "double" ],
        "cols": [
            [ 1686789517241103000, ...omit..., 1686789520231103000],
            [ -0.7638449771082523, ...omit..., 0.8211935584502427]
        ]
    },
    "success": true,
    "reason": "success",
    "elapse": "1.208166ms"
    }
    ```

This feature is the simplest way for deveropers to create RESTful APIs providing other applications accessing data.
