# How to start and stop Machbase Neo

### foreground

```sh
machbase-neo serve
```

### background

If pid file path is given, the process id of machbase-neo will be written on it.
It could be helpful later to stop the process running in background mode with `--daemon` option.

```sh
machbase-neo serve --daemon --pid ./machbase-neo.pid
```

### expose ports

machbase-neo runs and listens to only localhost by default for the security reason. If clients that runs remotely need to access machbase-neo through network, it requires to start with listen address as `--host <bind address>` option.

To allow listening to all available addresses, use `0.0.0.0`

```sh
machbase-neo serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

To allow a specific address, set the IP address of the host.

```sh
machbase-neo serve --host 192.168.1.10
```

## Stop

### foreground

If the server is running in foreground mode, simply press `Ctrl+C`.

###  background

If a pid file was generated, signal `SIGTERM` to process as like the command below.

```sh
kill `cat ./machbase-neo.pid`
```

Or use `shutdown` command. It works only if it is executed in the same host.

```sh
machbase-neo shell shutdown
```

## Windows

On Windows, double click "neow.exe" and "machbase-neo serve" button of the top left on the window.
