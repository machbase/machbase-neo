machbase-neo supports Transforming Query Language and execution API.

As application developers, we generally take similar approching to build applications that utilize databases.
The process is starting typically with quering database and retrieving data in a tabular form(rows and colums), converting it into the desired data structure,
then manipulating and displaying the final result into demanded shapes such as JSON, CSV or chart.

TQL is simplifying this process within few lines of script. And other inter-working applications call the TQL via HTTP endpoint as if it is an executable API.

## Generate data

Copy and paste the sample TQL code into the TQL editor.

```
FAKE( oscillator(freq(1.5, 1.0), range('now', '3s', '10ms')) )
CHART_LINE()
```

Then click ▶︎ icon on the top left of the editor, it will display a line chart as the below image. <br/>
which is a wave that has 1.5 Hz frequency and 1.0 amplitude.

Change `CHART_LINE()` to `CSV()` and execute again, it will show the result in CSV format.

## TQL as an API

Save this code as `hello.tql` (click save icon on the top right of the editor) and open it with web browser at [http://127.0.0.1:5654/db/tql/hello.tql](http://127.0.0.1:5654/db/tql/hello.tql), or use *curl* command on the terminal.

    ```sh
    curl -o - http://127.0.0.1:5654/db/tql/hello.tql
    ```

    ```sh
    $ curl -o - -v http://127.0.0.1:5654/db/tql/hello.tql
